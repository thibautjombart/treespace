*treespace*: exploration of landscapes of phylogenetic trees
============================================================

*treespace* implements new methods for the exploration and analysis of
distributions of phylogenetic trees for a given set of taxa.


Installing *treespace*
-------------
To install the development version from github:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("thibautjombart/treespace")
```

The stable version can be installed from CRAN using:
```{r install2, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("treespace")
```

Then, to load the package, use:
```{r load}
library("treespace")
```


Content overview
----------------

The main functions implemented in *treespace* are:

* __`treespace`__: explore landscapes of phylogenetic trees

* __`treespaceServer`__: open up an application in a web browser for an
  interactive exploration of the diversity in a set of trees

* __`findGroves`__: identify clusters of similar trees

* __`plotGroves`__: scatterplot of groups of trees, and __`plotGrovesD3`__ which
  enables interactive plotting based on d3.js

* __`medTree`__: find geometric median tree(s) to summarise a group of trees

* __`wiwTreeDist`__: find the distance between transmission trees by comparing their MRCI depth matrices

* __`wiwMedTree`__: find the median of a list of transmission scenarios

* __`relatedTreeDist`__: calculate the distances between trees whose tips belong to the same categories but are not necessarily identically labelled

* __`treeConcordance`__: calculate the concordance between a category tree and an individuals tree


Other functions are central to the computations of distances between trees:

* __`treeVec`__: characterise a tree by a vector

* __`treeDist`__: find the distance between two tree vectors

* __`multiDist`__: find the pairwise distances of a list of trees

* __`refTreeDist`__: find the distances of a list of trees from a reference tree

* __`tipDiff`__: for a pair of trees, list the tips with differing ancestry

* __`plotTreeDiff`__: plot a pair of trees, highlighting the tips with differing
  ancestry

* __`findMRCIs`__: find the most recent common infector (MRCI) matrix from "who infected whom" information

* __`tipsMRCAdepths`__: similar to `treeVec` but the output is a matrix where columns 1 and 2 correspond to tip labels and column 3 gives the depth of the MRCA of that pair of tips


Distributed datasets include:

* __`woodmiceTrees`__: illustrative set of 201 trees built using the
  neighbour-joining and bootstrapping example from the *woodmice* dataset in the
  *ape* documentation.

* __`DengueTrees`__: 500 trees sampled from a BEAST posterior set of trees from
  (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007)

* __`DengueSeqs`__: 17 dengue virus serotype 4 sequences from (Lanciotti *et
  al.*, 1997), from which the `DengueTrees` were inferred.

* __`DengueBEASTMCC`__: the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from the
  `DengueTrees`.
