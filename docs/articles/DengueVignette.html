<p>This vignette demonstrates the use of <em>treespace</em> to compare a collection of trees. For this example we use trees inferred from 17 dengue virus serotype 4 sequences from Lanciotti et al. (1997). We include a sample of trees from BEAST (v1.8), as well as creating neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees.</p>

<p>We load a random sample of 500 of the trees (from the second half of the posterior) produced using BEAST v1.8 with xml file 4 from Drummond and Rambaut (2007). It uses the standard GTR + Gamma + I substitution model with uncorrelated lognormal-distributed relaxed molecular clock. Each tree has 17 tips.</p>
<p>For convenience in our initial analysis we will take a random sample of 200 of these trees; sample sizes can be increased later.</p>

<p>From these plots we can see that <em>treespace</em> has identified variation in the trees according to the Kendall Colijn metric (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0\)</span>, ignoring branch lengths). The NJ and ML bootstrap trees have broadly similar topologies but are different from any of the BEAST trees. We can check whether any bootstrap trees have the same topology as either the NJ or ML tree, as follows:</p>

<p>This shows that the NJ tree has the same topology as one NJ bootstrap tree and one ML bootstrap tree. The ML tree has the same topology as 15 ML bootstrap trees, but no NJ bootstrap trees.</p>
<p>We can compare pairs of trees using the <code>plotTreeDiff</code> function to see exactly where their differences arise. Tips with identical ancestry in the two trees are coloured grey, whereas tips with differing ancestry are coloured peach-red, with the colour darkening according to the number of ancestral differences found at each tip. Since we are comparing the trees topologically (ignoring branch lengths, for the moment), we plot with constant branch lengths for clarity.</p>

<p>For pairwise comparisons it is helpful to find a small number of representative trees. We can find a geometric median tree from the BEAST trees using the <code>medTree</code> function:</p>

<p>so we may select one of them as a BEAST representative tree. Note that for a more thorough analysis it may be appropriate to identify clusters among the BEAST trees and select a summary tree from each cluster: we demonstrate this approach later in the vignette.</p>
