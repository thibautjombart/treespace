treespace v1.1.4.0
==================

We are very grateful to Joseph Tsui and Alexis Robert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for spotting an error in the way tip labels were handled in calculating transmission tree distances - this has now been fixed and a test added.

We are very grateful to Kurt Hornik for supplying this fix while Michelle was on maternity leave; the fix handles the update to the R base function `sample`.

treespace v1.1.3

We have updated the dependency details for the package `rgl` to ensure that the treespace Shiny app works on all operating systems: removed a few lines from a vignette which caused warnings on some operating systems; added a reference to the DESCRIPTION file as requested by Uwe, plus and URL and BugReports fields.
